# CS4110-Lexical-Analyzer
 Implement a lexical analyzer for a simple object-oriented programming language called Toy. Your program should be able to (1) translate any input Toy program into a sequence of tokens, and (2) create a symbol table using the trie structure for all keywords and user-defined identifiers.

# Python Version 3.9.0
If the yacc.py and lex.py included doesn't work, have the PLY plugins installed
